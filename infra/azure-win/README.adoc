= Deployment of phpOIDC to an Azure App Service (Windows) 
:icons: font

CAUTION: These templates only deploy the OpenID Connect Provider *without* the testing OpenID Connect Relying Party

Here are some points worth noting:

* MySQL Server firewall is set to prevent access from Azure and only accept connection coming from the App Service
* HTTPS is enforced
* Latest version of PHP is used (7.4)

[WARNING]
====
The purpose of these templates is to give you a kick-start, instantiating all of the required resources to run phpOIDC in Azure. *It should be used for testing only*.
For instance, here are things that should be fixed for production:

* *The used keys are for demo*
* SSL is not enforced by MySQL and not used by the PHP Code
* PHP Code is using administrator's credentials, not a dedicated account
====


== What is being deployed

* Azure App Service: The App service will be configured to use PHP
* App Service plan: In these templates, a Windows App Service is used
* Azure Database for MySQL: Its firewall is set based on the App Service IP

You can click on the button to visualize the deployed resources:

== Post-deployment

The database schema must be initialized. 
There are several ways to create the schema.

One way is to:

1. Go to the Azure Portal, on the App Service.
2. Go to the blade "Console".
3. Type the following commands:
----
cd phpOp
libs\bin\doctrine orm:schema-tool:create
